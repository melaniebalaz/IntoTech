                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    We live in a world where almost everything is in some way controlled or calculcated by a computer,
                    where most people use social media and information is shared online. And while this will increase
                    even more in the future, a lot of people perceive IT as magic, or too difficult to do themselves.
                    We would like to close that breach between the "users" and the "techgeeks",
                    and inspire people to get started with IT and utilize it for their own projects, to hang in there
                    through the maybe tough beginning and find a community to help them get further. <br><br>
                    <strong> After all, Tech is not that hard and it is a lot of fun to play around with,
                        especially when you are not on your own. </strong>

            'How come we can only define a method once?' <br/> <br/> Ever taught kids to code?
            They have this magical ability to take something you think you understand well and turn it upside down within an instant.
            They challenge norms and ask questions that you never thought could be asked. <br/><br/>
            Challenges aside, teaching has been an extraordinary turning point for me.
            I highly recommend it! You can take the lessons learned from doing so and turn them into valuable skills.
            These can help you become an active member of the developer community.
            Everyone can benefit from teaching, and not just from teaching kids!

            The people who contribute to an OSS project are the ones shaping its future.
            But if you've never contributed to an Open Source project before,
            it can be daunting to submit your first pull request and become part of its community,
            especially if you are from an underrepresented group in tech.
            This might keep you from contributing in the first place, meaning your voice, experience,
            and opinions will be lost.
            What if you could submit a pull request with confidence, contribute your skills & experience,
            and become a meaningful part of a project? <br/> <br/> My talk will explain what contributing to Open Source actually means,
            show the (social and technical) ways in which you can contribute,
            and present paths to get started with your first contribution.
            By the end, you will know how to find a project you‚Äôre passionate about,
            and how you can go about improving it and the Open Source community‚Äîone contribution at a time.

            A lot of people use spreadsheets in their daily lives. You can make lists, manage your finances, or even track your workouts! But it doesn't end there. Did you know that when you put all that data in a spreadsheet, you're basically creating a database? Once you start thinking "outside the spreadsheet", the possibilities for presenting the data in those little cells is endless. You can make interesting visualizations, websites, or even an app! I'll show you some examples of what I've made and talk about how you can use these techniques to collaborate on projects with people with many diverse skills.
