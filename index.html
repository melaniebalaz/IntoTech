                    IntoTech is a "get-together" kind of conference, offering spaces for meeting
                    the community, exchanging ideas and getting inspired.
                    We'll be offering a variety of handpicked talks and workshops,
                    targeted especially at IT beginners and newbies.

                    for our fellow geeks. Most of us are students at various stages of studying IT and
                    we have all been there - at that starting point where a terminal
                    is a magic window and code just gibberish.

                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    We live in a world where almost everything is in some way controlled or calculcated by a computer,
                    where most people use social media and information is shared online. And while this will increase
                    even more in the future, a lot of people perceive IT as magic, or too difficult to do themselves.
                    We would like to close that breach between the "users" and the "techgeeks",
                    and inspire people to get started with IT and utilize it for their own projects, to hang in there
                    through the maybe tough beginning and find a community to help them get further. <br><br>
                    <strong> After all Tech is not that hard and it is a lot of fun to play around with,
                        especially when you are not on your own. </strong>

                Do you have a cool project that uses technology to create an impact that you would like to share with the world?

                Are you a good public speaker and have on insight on how to teach technology, how to get people into programming
                or want to tell people what technology is all about? <br><br>
