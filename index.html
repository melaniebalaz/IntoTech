                    IntoTech is a "get-together" kind of conference, offering enough spaces for meeting
                    the community, exchanging ideas and getting inspired.
                    We'll be offering a variety of talks and workshops,
                    targeted especially at IT beginners and newbies.

                    We are a small team of tech-enthusiasts that want to create something nice
                    for our fellow geeks. Most of us are students in various stages of an IT degree and
                    we have all been there - at that starting point where a terminal
                    is a magic window and code just gibberish.

                    is that you register in time. How we make all this
                    possible? We're currently in the process of applying for a bunch of findings, and will approach
                    sponsors in due time.

                <h1 class="section-heading text-yellow">OUR VISION</h1>
                <p class="section-paragraph">
                    We live in a world where almost everything is in some way controlled or calculcated by a computer,
                    where most people use social media and information is shared online. And while this will increase
                    even more in the future, a lot of people perceive IT as magic, or too difficult to do themselves.
                    We would like to close that breach between the "users" and the "techgeeks",
                    and inspire people to get started with IT and utilize it for their own projects, to hang in there
                    through the maybe tough beginning and find a community to help them get further. <br><br>
                    <strong> Afterall Tech is not that hard and it is a lot of fun to play around with,
                        especially when you are not on your own. </strong>

                Do you have a cool project that uses technology to create an impact that you would like to share with the world?

                Are you a good public speaker and have on insight on how to teach technology, how to get people into programming
                or want to tell people what technology is all about? <br><br>
